# Truckly - Food Truck Drone Delivery
My team and I collaborated to create a drone delivery service. We combined this idea with food trucks so we can further expedite the delivery, based on location. This idea derived from our love of food and technology. Working together, we were able to create a web app that allow customers to order food from each food truck. Using Google Maps API, each customer can determine if they are within range of the trucks for drone delivery service. The app also allows administrative access to manage the food trucks.

## Installation
Run `bundle install` and it will install the following gems.

* geocoder
* boostrap

## Usage
Get started by scrolling down the page and creating an account. After you make an account you automatically get redirected to your account page. Click on the **Get Location** button. This will determine if there are food trucks near your location and display the food truck locations inside red circles. If you are within 2 miles of the truck locations, you can select the truck. This will bring to the order page, where you can place an order for 15 minute delivery via a drone.
